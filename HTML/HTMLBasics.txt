HTML ATTRIBUTES

All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element

When href = "#" Then it is said to be dead link

We can also create a image with a link by nesting img tag inside a tag

<a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

For unordered list we use ul tag and for ordered list we use ol tag

 <p>This is unordered list</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>


  <p>This is ordered list</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>

<abbr> = defines an abbreviation or acronym
<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

<address> = defines contact information for the author of a document
The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and 
browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.


<bdo> = defines the text direction (ovderide current text direction)
<bdo dir="rtl">This line will be written from right to left</bdo>
This line will be written from right to left

<blockquote> = defines a section that is quoted from another source (indents)
<cite> = defines the title of a work (renders in Italic)
<q> = defines a short inline quotation <insert quotations marks around>


<input type = "text" placeholder =  "This will be the text displayed in the input box" >


<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data">

  <input type = "text">
  <button type = "submit" > This will appear on button <button>

</form>

You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, 
you can just add the attribute required within your input element, like this: <input type="text" required>


<label for="loving"> <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label> 
for checkbox best practise
